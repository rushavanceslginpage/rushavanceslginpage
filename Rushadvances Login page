Only available to Texas residents: Only Texas residents are eligible for Brazos student loans, although you can use them to fund your own out-of-state education or to pay for another non-resident's education. 
Refinancing only available to bachelor's degree holders or higher: If you're refinancing student loans used to pay for an associate degree or you dropped out of school before finishing at least your bachelor's degree, you're not eligible for a Brazos refinance loan.
Deferment automatically ends in four and a half years for in-school borrowers: Ready or not, your deferment will end in 54 months from when you started school (or sooner if you are note enrolled at least half time). If you're still working on your degree after these four and half years, you'll need to begin making payments while finishing your studies.
Steep qualification requirements for refinances: Parents looking to borrow for a child's or someone else's education and those looking to refinance will need an income of at least $35,000 per year and a credit score of 680 or higher in qualify for these two student loan types. If you have a cosigner that meets these requirements, the requirements for the primary borrower become a bit lower.
