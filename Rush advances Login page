Brazos allows you to borrow up to your school-certified cost of attendance. This also includes living expenses, even for off-campus students. However, be aware that you have a four-and-a-half year runway (assuming you don't graduate or drop below half-time status first) before your deferment automatically ends, unless you meet the requirements for another deferment. If you hit the 54 months while still studying, your payments will begin immediately. If you graduate in four years or less you'll have a six-month grace period before payments start. Your period without payments cannot exceed a total of 54 months.6 This could be an important point for people who might be taking a bit longer to complete their degree.
